# Observe.

From the minute I could see, I have been observing my own conflicted dynamics;  through pieces like “Hangnail”, “Plucking Away”, I use acrylic paintings to highlight my relationship with my dual heritage and adversity through navigating obstacles. 

But this self-observation has expanded beyond self—shaping how I began to view relationships between people and their surroundings, watching how people harmonize and create conflict. “Man vs…” and “Synchronicity” both highlight my take on interactions within the community. All these observations of microcommunities encapsulate a bigger philosophy that defines how we see: through lenses. When we observe our surroundings, we see others. When others observe their surroundings, they observe me.
