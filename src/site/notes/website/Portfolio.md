#### **Description:**

Civilizations are built off of conflict, but conflict is more than a physical aspect. In our daily lives, conflicts with what traditional literature describes as “Man versus….” showcase our innate resilience to hard problems and shared experiences. In this triptych, I aim to record my own conflicts and conflicts happening in the world, taking in what I see as a reflection of different conflicts mirrored through the eyes of the victims. The first singular eye is my own eye which shows a reflection of myself. This represents Man vs Self, where my insecurities are amplified through my eyes, causing me to change innately as a person and self-reflect. The second eye is an Amur Leopard's, where Man vs Nature is reflected through the destruction of the leopard’s home in Northern China. Lastly, current conflicts between Man vs. Man are displayed through the dualistic nature of the two different peoples’ eyes from two sides of a war, looking at the destruction caused to both of their homes.

## **Home**

#### **Description:**

Home is not just a place, but rather a source of comfort. My home is not my house, but rather a steaming hot bowl of egg-tomato noodles. This noodle is one of the most recognized staples of all Mandarin-speaking households across the globe—its cultural significance lies as an ointment for homesickness. Like the chicken noodle soup, it’s simplistic, but it’s exactly this aspect that makes this dish more appealing than carefully crafted delicacies. These noodles bring socialization and create home—sitting and slurping noodles together. Chinese cuisines vary; some eat rice, while others eat wheat, but everyone eats noodles. In this piece, I juxtapose the saturated bowl of noodles with the monotonous colors of the background where the scallop dish lies. Although the color scheme used in both dishes is the same, the noodles still appear to be the favorite pick. When I ever feel homesick, I’ll make myself a bowl of egg-tomato noodles.

## **Laugh**
#### Graphite Pencil
#### 21in x 20in
#### 2023

#### **Description:**

Laughter is the universal expression of people of all ages. However, younger generations increasingly emphasize Nihilism, where people are discouraged from expressing their interests for fear of coming off as too passionate. The internet profits off of aesthetics that call to be uninteresting or off-putting. Apathy and nonchalance, as a result, become the norm for many young adults, males in particular, who are encouraged to act colder towards situations. This idea deeply impacts the way social interactions happen in the 21st century, where deeply passionate or emotional people are looked down upon as being too “nerdy” or “sentimental”, and even weak. In this artwork, I intentionally distorted my laughing face in an almost grotesque way to demonstrate this “insecurity” of showing an excessive emotional response, but rather than making it hidden, I showcase this vulnerability. Actively displaying emotions should not be something to hide from, but rather proudly embraced.
