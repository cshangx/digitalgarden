## Mission: Bridge STEM and ART 

There is a misconception that people who pursue STEM and people who pursue art majors are mutually exclusive; STEM students aren't encouraged to create good art, while art students are generally not suited for hard STEM subjects. In addition, many social and gender stereotypes have greatly caused a divide between these two areas, discouraging many people who might have wanted to try both to give up on one. The notion that STEM and art subjects are completely unrelated is wrong; throughout history, art and STEM have deeply connected and greatly influenced each other's progress. This project creates a collaborative gallery of STEM and art created by SAS students of elementary, middle, and high school age that displays the dependency of art with STEM. We hope that this event breaks stereotypes and makes the SAS community inspired and realize that STEM and art are not mutually exclusive subjects. 

## Event Statistics:

Throughout a couple of months, our team sent out posters and announcements to students in all grades in SAS Pudong to encourage them to submit their inspired works to our gallery. With the strong support of the SAS Pudong community of students, teachers, and staff, we collected 60 individual pieces of work from Grades 1 to Grade 12. In addition, 3 collections of artworks were collected from different classes that worked on relevant projects, such as the DesignTech class which featured designed items inspired by science or created using technology like 3D Printing, the middle school’s underwater ceramics project, and the microbiology artwork.

## Community Feedback & Votes

During the display of the gallery, our team observed a large influx of views of the START gallery among SAS students who pass through the hallway in the morning and during lunch to stop and discuss the displays and watch the video displayed on the large screen. 
While the START Gallery was on display, our team set up voting polls for people to vote on their favorite artworks; the votes came from a large demographic as well. There were students from elementary to high school who voted, teachers who voted, and surprisingly, visitors from outside of school who voted.
From these votes, we can see some of our real impact on the community start to emerge. The votes were highly diverse, with people voting on videos, sculptures, and photographs across all grade levels.
>[!quote] The use of engineering in art is really interesting, especially the interlocked suspended cubes that don’t seem to touch but magically float. Never knew how much art and engineering were related before

>[!quote] Beautiful craftsmanship and a neat idea for Tesseract light.

## We hope that in the future, one student’s pursuit of interdisciplinary passion may be rooted in our START Event.

### Later Plans? 

I hope to expand this event into universities. This is a lifelong passion of mine, especially as I enter both the STEM and art fields.
