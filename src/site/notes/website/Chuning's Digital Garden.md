### Who Am I?

I'm Chuning Shang, a senior at Shanghai American School Pudong Campus!

There's no possible way to describe me in a few words, or even a few sentences; there are no singular guides to unravel my personality, nor are there any keywords to describe my interests.

This website offers a small sliver of me. Interpret me like an **artwork**. 

Enjoy!
